INTRODUCTION                                      *vim-cdroot-introduction*
------------

When navigating within a project, it can be useful to set the current directory 
to either the directory of the current file, or the project root. Vim provides
*autochdir* to automatically change the directory to that of the current file.  
However, this can make it a bit of a nuisance when you want to find a file in a 
'sibling' directory.

This plugin provides the command :Root , which will set the current dir to
the root of your version controlled project (currently only git supported) or
one of a set of 'privileged' directories, if you are in a child directory of 
one of these version controlled or privileged roots.


COMMANDS                                          *vim-cdroot-commands*
--------

:Root[!]                  Change to the root of the git repo, or a privilaged
                          parent.
                          With [!], the resulting current dir will be echoed.


OPTIONS                                           *vim-cdroot-options*
-------

g:non_git_roots           List of roots to privilege if not in a git repo.
                          These can use env vars or '~', as vim's 'expand'
                          will be used to generate an actual path.


EXAMPLES                                          *vim-cdroot-examples*
--------

I keep all my plaintext notes in side Dropbox. This folder has various
subfolders. By adding the root '~/Dropbox/notes' to my g:non_git_roots,
whenever I'm anywhere within that dir I can use :Root to set the parent to the
root notes folder.

From within '~/Dropbox/notes/software/vim':

    let g:non_git_roots=['~/Dropbox/notes']
    
    :Root!
    # Root: /home/davison/Dropbox/notes
